### Action Module Overview

This module provides the `Action` interface for defining actions within the application. 

### Action Interface

The `Action` interface is a fundamental building block for representing actions within the application. It serves as a blueprint for defining the structure and behavior of actions. 

**Interface Definition**

```typescript
import { Action } from "./Action";

export { Action };
```

**Properties and Methods**

The `Action` interface doesn't have any properties or methods defined directly. Instead, it serves as a base for extending and implementing specific action types within the application. 

**Usage Example**

```typescript
// Example of extending the Action interface 
interface MyAction extends Action {
  type: 'MY_ACTION';
  payload: any;
}

// Example of creating an instance of the MyAction interface 
const myAction: MyAction = {
  type: 'MY_ACTION',
  payload: 'some data'
};
```


**Note:** 
The absence of specific properties and methods in the `Action` interface allows for flexibility in defining actions that suit the specific needs of the application. This approach promotes code reusability and maintainability.
