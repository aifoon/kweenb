**kweenb** is the audio management software where you can:

- Manage the swarm by adding new bees, activating or deactivating them.
- Connect the active swarm to start streaming audio with Jacktrip, supporting both peer-to-peer and hub mode.
- Connect the active swarm to start triggering actions via OSC.
- Disconnect the swarm and cleanup all the open connections
- Adjust the Jack and Jacktrip settings used during connection.
- Upload and manage audio files on each bee
- Use positioning that interacts with the MQTT server of Pozyx and translates that data into audio parameters (e.g. volume)
- Configure the bee by calling endpoints from zwerm3-api
- Use various tools to validate each step in the connection process.
